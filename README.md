The running of the final project is through Jupyter lab or Jupyter notebook. You can run the project on either one, which ever one is better suited for you. 
To download jupyter notebook or lab - https://test-jupyter.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install.html#:~:text=While%20Jupyter%20runs%20code%20in,installation%20in%20the%20next%20section.
Or you can download it through Anaconda- https://anaconda.org/conda-forge/jupyterlab

To open the file in jupyter- download the ipynb file and then add the file into your directory and it will open the notebook 
My project was created with python  3.11.5
